    "description":"I am a web developer with hands-on experience in Spring Boot, Asp.Net Core Web Api, Laravel and Angular (TypeScript). I have a strong interest in technology and software development, and I’m always eager to improve my skills and learn new things. My long-term dream is to run my own software company, where I can lead meaningful projects and help others grow in tech. Outside of work, I enjoy meditation, reading, and spending quality time talking with my both sisters—they keep me grounded and inspired."
